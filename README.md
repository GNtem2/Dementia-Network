# Dementia-Network
This is a network of relationship built around the pubmed search for the term "dementia". Genes were extracted from pubmed library. These genes were interogated with a list of terms "human","dementia","vascular dementia","alzheimer", "frontotemporal","lewy body dementia","cognition", "behaviour","aging", "stroke","inflammation","hypertension", "amyoid","tau","atherosclerosis","endothelial dysfunction","gut brain". This process was done using latent semantic analysis in pubmed.mineR. The node name in the name column was copied onto the Label column in Gephi. The data were saved as graphml file and uploaded onto Gephi 0.92. The [interactive graph](https://gntem2.github.io/Dementia-Network/) was created using sigma.js. This step requires manual editing of the config file with labelThreshold 5.
